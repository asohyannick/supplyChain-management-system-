**Welcome to the Backend Development Repository of the SupplyChainManagementSystem Project**
This document provides comprehensive information about the backend development section of the project, along with excellent guidelines on how, where, and who can contribute to the development and success of this amazing project.

Modern Technologies We're Using to Develop the Backend Web Services or RESTful API Endpoints
**Node.js**:
Node.js is a powerful runtime environment that enables server-side JavaScript execution. By leveraging its non-blocking, event-driven architecture, we achieve high scalability and performance in our backend. This allows us to handle multiple concurrent connections efficiently, making it an ideal choice for building fast and responsive applications.

**Express.js**:
Express.js is a minimalist web framework for Node.js that simplifies the development of robust APIs. With its intuitive routing and middleware support, Express.js enhances our ability to build scalable, robust and secure API endpoints in the Backend Development Project. This framework streamlines request handling and error management, ensuring a smooth development experience.

**Json Web Token(JWT)**enables secure, scalable, and robust APIs for integrating user and admin authentication and authorization. By issuing access tokens, JWT facilitates the validation and authentication of users and administrators. This functionality not only streamlines the authentication process but also safeguards resources within our backend and REST API, ensuring a secure environment for all interactions.
**CORS**
Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) is essential for enabling secure cross-origin requests in our APIs. By configuring CORS, we allow specified domains to interact with our  backend, enhancing flexibility while maintaining strict security measures. This ensures that our resources are accessible only to trusted origins, thereby protecting sensitive data.

**Helmet**
Helmet is a middleware that strengthens our application's security by setting various HTTP headers. By mitigating risks such as cross-site scripting and clickjacking, Helmet enhances the overall security posture of the  backend. This proactive approach helps protect user data and ensures compliance with best security practices.

**Compression**
Compression is a vital performance optimization technique that reduces the size of response bodies in our APIs. By utilizing compression, we significantly decrease loading times and improve user experience in the application. This efficient data transfer not only conserves bandwidth but also enhances overall application responsiveness.

**Express-Rate-Limit**
Express-Rate-Limit is a crucial middleware that prevents abuse and ensures fair usage of our APIs. By implementing rate limiting, we can restrict the number of requests a user can make in a given timeframe. This safeguards our  backend from potential DDoS attacks and enhances the stability of our services.

**Bcryptjs**
Bcryptjs is a robust library used for hashing passwords securely in our application. By employing bcrypt, we ensure that user credentials are stored in a secure manner, making it significantly more difficult for attackers to compromise sensitive data. This enhances the security of user accounts in the  backend, fostering trust and reliability.

**Docker**: 
Docker is a containerization platform that enables us to package applications and their dependencies into isolated environments. By utilizing Docker, we ensure consistent deployment across various stages of development in the  project. This technology simplifies the management of application dependencies, enhancing portability and scalability.

**Firebase API Integration**
Firebase API facilitates custom and third-party authentication and authorization, streamlining user managementa and login with their various Google accounts in our application. By integrating Firebase, we enhance the  backend with secure authentication options, allowing for seamless user experiences. This flexibility enables us to support various authentication methods while ensuring robust security measures.

Folder Descriptions
**Config**: Contains configuration files essential for customizing the behavior of the Express.js application. This includes files for application properties and YAML configurations, allowing developers to specify important settings such as:

Server Ports: Defines the port on which the Express application will run.
Database Connections: Configures connection strings for various databases used by the application.
Logging Configurations: Sets up logging preferences to monitor application behavior and performance.
Controllers: Contains classes or functions responsible for handling incoming HTTP requests, defining RESTful endpoints, and processing data. Controllers receive requests, interact with services, and return appropriate responses to the client.

**Enums**: Holds enumerations, which represent a fixed set of constant values in the application. Enums provide a convenient way to define and work with predefined options, such as status codes, types, or categories.

**Models**: Stores the data models or entities that represent the structure and behavior of the application's domain. These classes or functions typically map to database tables or external data sources, defining the properties and relationships of the application's data.

**Middleware**: Contains classes or functions related to application security, including configurations for authentication and authorization. It may include components such as security configurations, authentication providers, access control rules, and custom security-related functions.

**Services**: Encapsulates the business logic of the application. Services provide a layer of abstraction between the controllers and models, handling complex operations, processing data, and enforcing business rules.

**Service Implementors**: Holds classes or functions that implement the interfaces defined in the Services folder. These classes contain the actual implementation of the business logic and interact with models and other components to fulfill the functionality defined by the services.

**Utils**: Holds utility classes or helper functions that provide reusable functionality across the application. These classes or functions offer common tasks like data conversion, string manipulation, file handling, and more. They promote code organization, reduce duplication, and facilitate access to shared functionality.
