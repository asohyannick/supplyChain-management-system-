**Welcome to the Backend Development Repository of the AirMailGo Project**
This document provides comprehensive information about the backend development section of the project, along with excellent guidelines on how, where, and who can contribute to the development and success of this amazing project.

Modern Technologies We're Using to Develop the Backend Web Services or RESTful API Endpoints
**Node.js**: An open-source JavaScript runtime environment that provides core APIs and modules to develop the backend application with minimal effort, enabling us to create highly scalable networking applications like AirMailGo.

**Express.js**: An open-source JavaScript-based framework that simplifies the development of large-scale enterprise applications. It offers a comprehensive set of built-in middleware, APIs, and libraries that are flexible, scalable, and secure, facilitating the development of our backend web services or RESTful API endpoints.

**Docker**: This will be integrated in the upcoming phases of the project to help us containerize and deploy our backend infrastructure more efficiently to the cloud for production.

Stay Updated: More modern technologies may be added as we progress through the development phases of this great project.

Folder Descriptions
**Config**: Contains configuration files essential for customizing the behavior of the Express.js application. This includes files for application properties and YAML configurations, allowing developers to specify important settings such as:

Server Ports: Defines the port on which the Express application will run.
Database Connections: Configures connection strings for various databases used by the application.
Logging Configurations: Sets up logging preferences to monitor application behavior and performance.
Controllers: Contains classes or functions responsible for handling incoming HTTP requests, defining RESTful endpoints, and processing data. Controllers receive requests, interact with services, and return appropriate responses to the client.

**Enums**: Holds enumerations, which represent a fixed set of constant values in the application. Enums provide a convenient way to define and work with predefined options, such as status codes, types, or categories.

**Models**: Stores the data models or entities that represent the structure and behavior of the application's domain. These classes or functions typically map to database tables or external data sources, defining the properties and relationships of the application's data.

**Middleware**: Contains classes or functions related to application security, including configurations for authentication and authorization. It may include components such as security configurations, authentication providers, access control rules, and custom security-related functions.

**Services**: Encapsulates the business logic of the application. Services provide a layer of abstraction between the controllers and models, handling complex operations, processing data, and enforcing business rules.

**Service Implementors**: Holds classes or functions that implement the interfaces defined in the Services folder. These classes contain the actual implementation of the business logic and interact with models and other components to fulfill the functionality defined by the services.

**Utils**: Holds utility classes or helper functions that provide reusable functionality across the application. These classes or functions offer common tasks like data conversion, string manipulation, file handling, and more. They promote code organization, reduce duplication, and facilitate access to shared functionality.

How to Contribute to the Backend Development Phase of This Project
**Clone the Git Repository**: Developers should clone this Git repository from GitHub. It is also advisable to request the environment variables for this project before installing the necessary dependencies and running the development server with the following commands:
# npm install
# npm run dev
Pick a Task from the Developer Brief: Developers should select a task from the developer brief and work on it effectively and professionally to meet client expectations.

Create a Branch on GitHub: Developers should create a local branch that reflects the task chosen from the developer brief. After completing the task, push the local branch to the main remote branch on GitHub. Clear and concise commit messages should be used and committed successfully before pushing to the remote repository.
